'Face Off is at its heart a cheesy action movie.  Getting past that it is an entertaining movie that is worth every second.  Some baller quotes and Nicolas Cage behaving as insane as ever.':

'Heat is not a cheesy action movie.  The story is very well developed with the heist taking center stage.  The respect that Pacino and DeNiro''s characters have for eachother is admirable.':
